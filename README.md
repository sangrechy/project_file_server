# 📁 FileCloud — Simple File Sharing Server

FileCloud is a simple file-sharing server built with **Node.js and Express**. It allows devices on the same network to browse folders and download files through a web browser.

## ✨ Features

* Browse folders and files
* Download files
* Breadcrumb navigation
* Simple dark-mode interface
* Secure file path handling
* Works on Wi-Fi or Ethernet LAN

## 🛠️ Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) LTS
* A browser

## 📥 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sangrechy/project_file_server.git
cd project_file_server/app
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

If dependencies are not already listed in `package.json`, install them with:

```bash
npm install express multer
```

> `path`, `fs`, and `os` are built-in Node.js modules.

### 3. Create the shared folder

Create a `files` folder inside the `app` directory:

```bash
mkdir files
```

Put the files you want to share inside this folder.

## ▶️ Start the Server

Run:

```bash
node app.js
```

The server will display an address such as:

```text
File manager running at http://192.168.1.5:3000
```

Open this address in a browser on any device connected to the same network.

Example:

```text
http://192.168.1.5:3000
```

## 🌐 External Access

You can use **ngrok** to access the server from outside your local network.

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Ngrok will provide a public URL that can be opened from another network.

## 🔐 Security

* Only files inside the `files` directory are accessible.
* The server is read-only.
